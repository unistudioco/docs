Squeditor templates can support drastically different visual identities simultaneously using the nested `themes` configuration object. This is exceptionally useful when you need to showcase a single component system mapped into entirely different client aesthetics or when you want to create multi-purpose templates.

## Configuration

Instead of maintaining separate codebase forks, you declare targeted page arrays mapped directly to discrete SCSS override files within your `squeditor.config.js`.

```javascript squeditor.config.js

module.exports = {
  // ...
  themes: {
    'agency': {
      label: 'Agency Theme',
      bodyClass: 'theme-agency',
      scss: 'src/assets/scss/themes/_agency.scss',
      pages: ['/', '/about.php', '/services.php'],
      distSubfolder: 'demo-agency',
    },
    'saas': {
      label: 'SaaS Theme',
      bodyClass: 'theme-saas',
      scss: 'src/assets/scss/themes/_saas.scss',
      pages: ['/landing.php', '/pricing.php'],
      distSubfolder: 'demo-saas',
    },
  },
  
  // The theme rendering currently active during the local PHP dev server
  activeTheme: 'agency', 
}
```

## Handles Overrides

During the `npm run build:css` step, the Squeditor `build-components.js` script dynamically rewrites the last import in your `src/assets/scss/main.scss` framework file.

### Inside `main.scss`

```scss
@import 'tokens';
@import 'base';
@import 'components';
@import 'uikit-overrides';
@import 'utilities';

// DO NOT edit the line below manually. It is dynamically rewritten by the compiler to target the active theme.
@import 'themes/agency'; 
```

Since the target theme block loads last, its root `--sq-*` tokens completely override entirely every preceding design token organically.

## Production Isolation

When `npm run build:snap` generates your static HTML snapshot deliverables, the crawler reads your `themes` array recursively. 

It generates entirely separate directories in your `/dist` output for each theme, evaluating exactly only the specific `pages` array declared for that specific design system without leaking dependencies.

```text
/dist
  /demo-agency
    index.html
    about.html
  /demo-saas
    landing.html
```
