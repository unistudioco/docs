## Deploying & Archiving

Once you execute the `npm run build` command, the framework evaluates the HTML snapshot and automatically calls the `squeditor/scripts/package-dist.js` archiver. 

This guarantees sealed deliverables ready for handoff without manual file manipulation.

## The Archiver Generation

Squeditor navigates the `dist/` directory and creates a clean `<project-name>-dist.zip` package file securely inside the root directory. This contains the flat HTML files, the compiled CSS/JS assets, and the copied static folder (images, fonts).

## Automated Host Deployment

Squeditor integrates directly with modern Node deployers (Netlify or Vercel). Upon generating the final ZIP deliverable, the script reads your deployment preference.

In `squeditor.config.js`:
```javascript
  // Distribution routing instructions
  dist: {
    zipName: 'my-project-dist.zip',
    previewPlatform: 'netlify', // options: 'netlify' or 'vercel'
  },
```

If set to `netlify`, the framework runs `netlify deploy --dir=dist --open`, which uploads the static flat HTML files to a temporary Edge URL and automatically launches it in your default web browser for immediate client review.
