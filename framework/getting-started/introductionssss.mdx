## Welcome

**Squeditor Framework** is a high-performance, developer-first framework for building lightning-fast, static websites. It combines the power of **PHP-style templating** with the modern performance of **Tailwind CSS**, the interactivity of **UIKit 3**, and the speed of **Vite**.

<Note>
  Squeditor Framework is NOT a WordPress theme framework or a CMS. It is a build-time framework that uses PHP for development and outputs 100% flat, portable HTML/CSS/JS for production and compatible with Squeditor, Elementor, Gutenberg, and other page builders.
