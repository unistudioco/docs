Follow these steps to set up your core workspace root, scaffold a new project, and start development.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installation">
    Clone the repository to serve as your core workspace root:
    
    ```bash > Terminal
    git clone https://github.com/unistudioco/squeditor-workspace.git
    cd squeditor-workspace
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scaffold a New Project">
    Squeditor Framework includes a robust CLI scaffolding tool. It generates a completely clean, minimalist `project-template/` instance next to the core framework, fully pre-configured to utilize the advanced GSAP and UIKit engines without demo bloat.

    To scaffold your new project, run the following command from the workspace root:

    ```bash > Terminal
    node squeditor/scripts/scaffold.js my-awesome-project
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Development">
    Navigate into your newly generated project folder, install its dependencies, and start the development server:

    ```bash > Terminal
    cd my-awesome-project
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Use Port 3001 for Development**
      
      Vite will show a link to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` in your terminal. **Do not use that link.**
      
      Instead, always visit the PHP Server address: **`http://127.0.0.1:3001`**. This is because Squeditor Framework uses PHP for template rendering, and Vite only serves the static assets.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build for Production">
    Generate the static `dist/` folder and a distributable ZIP archive:

    ```bash > Terminal
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
