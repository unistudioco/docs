# The Style Guide Page

Squeditor includes an automated `style-guide.php` component map that visually catalogues every single UIKit3 UI element currently enabled in your project's configuration array.

This acts as a live, single-source-of-truth document.

## How it Generates

Whenever you execute `npm run build:css`, the framework's internal bundler parses the `components[]` array defined in your `squeditor.config.js`. 

Alongside copying the exact JS and SCSS dependencies, the bundler automatically rewrites a temporary PHP data file located at `src/config/active-components.php`.

```php
// Auto-generated by squeditor/scripts/build-components.js
$active_components = ["sticky","modal","accordion","tabs","offcanvas"];
```

## Rendering the Interface

Your `src/style-guide.php` template uses this exact generated array to organically instantiate every component sequentially dynamically using the `get_component` helper organically.

```php
<?php
// Read active components from config 
require_once __DIR__ . '/config/active-components.php'; 

ob_start();
?>

<div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-20">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Project Style Guide</h1>

  <?php foreach ($active_components as $component): ?>
    <section class="mb-20" id="component-<?= $component ?>">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold capitalize"><?= $component ?></h2>
      
      <!-- Crucial: We pass ['demo' => true] so the snippet populates placeholder text rather than breaking via empty loops -->
      <?php get_component($component, ['demo' => true]); ?>
    </section>
  <?php endforeach; ?>
</div>
```

<Warning>
To prevent PHP looping errors since this file runs universally, ensure every template part within your `src/components/` folder evaluates `if ($demo)` blocks appropriately so it outputs dummy DOM structures when no structural data overrides are explicitly passed. 
</Warning>
