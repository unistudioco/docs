ScrollSmoother provides physically continuous, buttery inertia-based scrolling and native page-level parallax support. In the Squeditor framework, you do **not** need to manually define the wrapper/content divs in your template, nor do you write JavaScript. 

Simply attribute the `<body>` tag, and the engine automatically injects the fixed scroll viewports and protects external structural elements appropriately.

## Usage

Enable ScrollSmoother by passing the configuration via the `data-gsap-smooth` attribute on the `<body>` element. In the standard PHP template, you can control this by defining a `$body_attr` variable before `base.php` is included.

### Basic Example:

```php
// In any page template, before including base.php
$body_attr = 'data-gsap-smooth="smooth: 1.5; effects: true"';
```

### When rendered, the HTML behaves like this:

```html
<body data-gsap-smooth="smooth: 1.5; effects: true">
  <!-- The GSAP engine automatically wraps the main content and footer for you. -->
</body>
```

## Parallax Attributes 

With `effects: true` active, simply drop these attributes onto any element within the smoothed container:

```html
<!-- Moves 1.2x as fast as normal scroll (foreground) -->
<div data-speed="1.2">Fast Layer</div>

<!-- Moves 0.6x as fast (deep background) -->
<div data-speed="0.6">Slow Layer</div>

<!-- Follows scrolling instantly, but takes 0.5s to snap fully into position -->
<div data-lag="0.5">Trailing Object</div>
```

## Options

Pass standard ScrollSmoother parameters dynamically through the string configuration.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smooth` | `number` | `1.5` | The delay time (in seconds) it takes the container to catch up to the native scroll position. |
| `effects` | `boolean` | `true` | Scans the DOM for `data-speed` and `data-lag` attributes to enable instant automatic parallax. |
| `smoothTouch` | `number` \| `boolean` | `0.1` | Allows smoothing on touch devices (keep this extremely low if enabled). |
