## Attribute: `data-sq-loop-panels`

[View Demo](#)

This module stacks full-height sections naturally. As you scroll, each new panel snaps into the viewport, layering atop the previous section.

## Usage

Apply `data-sq-loop-panels` to a wrapper. Its direct children become the panels.

### Basic Example

```html
<div data-sq-loop-panels>
  <section class="sq-loop-panel" style="background: #111;">
    <h2>Panel 1</h2>
  </section>
  <section class="sq-loop-panel" style="background: #FFF;">
    <h2>Panel 2</h2>
  </section>
  <section class="sq-loop-panel" style="background: #333;">
    <h2>Panel 3</h2>
  </section>
</div>
```
